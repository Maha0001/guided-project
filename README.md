# Capstone Project: Employee Retention Analysis at Sailfort Motors

## Overview

This capstone project allows me to apply and evaluate the data analytical skills I have gained. The project focuses on understanding and improving employee retention at Sailfort Motors, a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. 

Through the project, I will:

- Set up the team’s workflow.
- Create a project proposal.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Build machine learning models.
- Share insights and recommendations through an executive summary.
- Interact with internal and external stakeholders.

## Objectives

The goal of the project is to gather, analyze, and present data to answer questions related to employee retention. This includes:

1. Analyzing data to identify factors influencing employee attrition.
2. Building statistical and machine learning models to predict whether an employee will leave the company.
3. Presenting insights to a non-technical audience, including ethical considerations related to the task.

## Project Scenario

### Company Overview: Sailfort Motors

Sailfort Motors is a leading global manufacturer of alternative energy vehicles. Headquartered in France, Sailfort designs and builds electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. With a workforce of over 100,000 employees, Sailfort uses a vertically integrated business model, making it a leader in the alternative energy automotive space.

### Business Case: Employee Retention

As a data specialist, I have been tasked by the senior leadership team to analyze data from an employee survey. The goal is to identify factors that contribute to employee attrition and develop a predictive model that can help the company reduce turnover. Key variables include department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and others.

## Data Overview

The project uses the **HR_capstone_dataset.csv**, which contains self-reported data from Sailfort Motors employees. 

- **Rows**: 14,999 (one for each employee)
- **Columns**: 10 (employee attributes)

### Data Dictionary:

| Column Name           | Data Type   | Description                                              |
|-----------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| satisfaction_level     | int64       | Employee's satisfaction level (range: 0–1)               |
| last_evaluation        | int64       | Score of the last performance review (range: 0–1)        |
| number_project         | int64       | Number of projects the employee contributes to           |
| average_monthly_hours  | int64       | Average number of hours worked per month                 |
| time_spend_company     | int64       | Employee tenure at the company (in years)                |
| work_accident          | int64       | Whether the employee had a work accident (1: Yes, 0: No) |
| left                   | int64       | Whether the employee left the company (1: Yes, 0: No)    |
| promotion_last_5years  | int64       | Whether promoted in the last 5 years (1: Yes, 0: No)     |
| department             | str         | Employee’s department                                    |
| salary                 | str         | Employee’s salary level (low, medium, or high)           |

## Key Steps

1. **Project Proposal**: Outlining the business problem and goals of the analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying trends and patterns in the dataset.
3. **Model Building**: Developing machine learning models to predict employee attrition.
4. **Ethical Considerations**: Evaluating the ethical impact of predictions on employees' careers.
5. **Presentation**: Sharing insights and final recommendations with stakeholders.

## Conclusion

This project showcases how data analytics can provide insights into organizational issues like employee retention. The final output will include predictive models, data visualizations, and an executive summary of findings.
